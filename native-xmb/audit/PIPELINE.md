# XMB render pipeline: firmware source of each layer

Goal: output identical to the PS3 XMB, implemented in C++. Every layer has to come from the firmware's own programs,
parameters and assets. This file records where each layer comes from in the 4.93 firmware and how far the port has got.

Local inventory (`out/native-reference/qrc-inventory.txt`, not committed) lists every `vsh/resource/qgl/*.qrc`.

## Layers, back to front

| Layer | Firmware source | Native status |
|---|---|---|
| Background gradient | `lines.qrc` moyou/background, back_colours0 + month_bg textures, BACKGROUND.mnu; custom_render_plugin clock mapping | **Ported**: firmware Cg translated RSX→GLSL, inputs traced |
| Ribbon (wave sheet) | `lines.qrc` lines1 / ffd_shader1 / LinesController, LINE1.mnu; FFD wave field from the SPU spline.elf | **Ported**: shaders firmware; geometry fitted to reference (spline.elf placement not traced) |
| Particles | `lines.qrc` particles_quads / particles_second, PARTICLES*.mnu; simulation runs on SPU particles.elf | **Partial**: shaders firmware; CPU simulation reconstructs the SPU job |
| HDR tone map + glare | `lines.qrc` glutils ToneMap, GlareSource*, Gaussian, AccGlare, ApplyGlare, HDR.mnu | **Ported** |
| Category icons | `icons.qrc` lib/icons/quad.vpo + icons_{full,cheap,no}_ss[_no_shad].fpo + mask.fpo; ICONS.mnu with day/night/yoake/higure/boot overrides; widgets/other/texenv.dds (env map), amb.bmp; `icontex.qrc` 1n–70n normal maps + dif | **Ported** (`icons.cpp`): firmware quad.vpo + icons_no_ss_no_shad.fpo, the variant the firmware runs at 1080p; uniforms from ICONS.mnu by the packing read from an RPCS3 capture; matches RPCS3's frame side by side |
| Item icons, labels, dialogs, info bar | explore_plugin / system_plugin via paf (RCO layouts and textures) | **Reconstructed**: RCO textures are the firmware's; positions, sizes and fades measured from the 60 fps reference |
| Text | paf font renderer with the RD-R/B (SCE-PS3 Rodin) faces from dev_flash/data/font | **Partial**: native-resolution GL glyph atlas, Qt shaping/rasterization; PAF coverage/style trace in TEXT-RENDERER.md; hinting and glow parity open |

`raf.qrc` (ubber shaders, ConeFilter), `rhm.qrc`, `canyon.qrc`/`earth.qrc` (visualiser themes) and `store.qrc` are
outside the main XMB.

## Category icon renderer (ported 2026-10-25)

How it was resolved: the plugin's VMX packing code decompiles too poorly to read, so the values were taken from a real
run instead. The local RPCS3 build gained `XMB_FP_DUMP` (each fragment program as drawn, constants patched in, plus
vertex constants and texture units), and `re-ps3-native --decode-fp` turns a capture back into named uniforms.
Findings, now in `icons.h`:

- At 1920x1080 the firmware runs `icons_no_ss_no_shad` (SHADOW STREN is 0).
- Camera distance is 2700; ndc = (2.8125 X, 5 Y) / d, so world units are 1080p pixels.
- Quads are 117.13 px (unfocused) and 167.33 px (focused), with icons 200 px apart plus 10 px either side of focus.
  The focus column is at x 565, y 290 (280 focused). Item icons in the open column use the same shader at 85.55 px.
- `_Ambiant.w` is 0.698 for unfocused icons and 1 for focused ones. The program's alpha (envmap alpha × `_Ambiant.w`)
  blends the icon over the frame.
- Light directions are (sin Z cos X, sin Z sin X, cos Z) of the LITn angles. `_EnvRot` turns about 30°/s.
- tex3 is a 128×128 px CookieCutter cut of the frame around each icon, refracted per channel.

Translator fixes found by diffing against RPCS3's own GLSL for this program (`Log shader programs`):
- LIF (0x3C) is (1, y, y>0 ? 2^w : 0, 1), not full LIT. This was why the icons came out saturated white.
- DIVSQ uses sqrt(|b|) and keeps a when a is 0; NRM leaves zero-length vectors alone.
- Source and destination precision clamps (fixed12 ±2, fixed9 ±1, saturate), with NaN read as 0.
- H registers are rounded to fp16. H and R are not aliased (RPCS3 keeps them apart).

Still open: `_ChangingColor` and `_LuminanceParams` are the captured night values, so a day capture is needed. Item
icons in the open column still go through Qt. The background is brighter than RPCS3's at the same hour, which also
lightens the refracted unfocused icons. Diagnosis: `XMB_ICON_UCODE=<capture>` runs on the firmware's captured
constants; `XMB_ICON_DEBUG=0..4` shows a single input texture or the result.

### Original notes

The firmware draws category icons as lit glass. Each icon is a quad (quad.vpo, `_ModelviewProjection`,
`_CookieCutterCenter/Ratio`). The fragment programs read these:

- `_NormalMap` (tex0): icontex `Nn`. Its alpha channel is the coverage, and a second fetch at a shadow offset gives the
  shadow.
- `_DiffuseMap` (tex1) and `_EnvMap` (tex2): `texenv.dds`, rotated by `_EnvRot`.
- `_BackgroundMap` (tex3): the frame behind the icon, refracted per channel (`REFR R/G/B` −0.032/−0.038/−0.048,
  `REFR SCL`, `REFR BLUR`).
- Two specular lights: `_PackedLightParams[4]` from `LIT1/LIT2 ANG Z/X`, `ATTN *`, `SPEC1/2 POW`.
- `_Ambiant` from `AMB R/G/B`; `_LuminanceParams[4]`, `EXPOSE`; `_ChangingColor` (theme colour, `TIME COLOR MIX`,
  `GLASS`); `_ParallaxAndGlow` (`PAR SCL/BIAS`); `_ShadowParams` (`SHADOW STREN/X/Y`).
- `_SuperSampling` (`MULTI SAMP` 0.5, `MULTI ROT` 30°): the icon is antialiased inside the shader. `SS METHOD`
  chooses full, cheap or none.

custom_render_plugin builds the ICONS menu object at FUN_00047xxx (MNU reads around line 27540 of the local
decompile) and binds the uniforms in FUN_000428b8…FUN_00042b2c (offsets: +0x00 PackedLightParams, +0x60 ChangingColor,
+0x90 Ambiant, +0xC0 ParallaxAndGlow, +0xF0 Eye, +0x120 EnvRot, +0x150 ShadowParams, +0x180 LuminanceParams,
+0x1E0 RefractParams, +0x210 SuperSampling). The function that packs the MNU values into those uniforms still has to
be traced, as was done for back_colours0. `--dump-cg` now also writes the icons programs.
